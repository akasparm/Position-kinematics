# Robot kinematics:

###	Prerequisites:
		1. The program requires following libraries to be installed: sympy
	
###	Input:
		1. The program doesn't ask for any input from the user. User can directly run the code and get the result.
		
###	Output:
		1. Firstly, The program shows the transformation matrices in the following order:
			0T1, 1T2, 2T3, 3T4, 4T5, 5T6, 6T7
		2. Then, it calculates the homogenous matrix by multiplying the transformation matrices and displays it according to different configurations mentioned in the report.

###	Notes:
		1. For showing the super and subscript, Unicodes are used.
